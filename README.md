CST381/411 Genetic Search Algorithm for N Queens Problem


Implement N-Queens genetic algorithm as described in lecture 5-1 with the following meta-parameters:
• Size of the breeding set is 1/10 of sample population
• Number of generations of reproduction is 50
• Number of breeding pairs is 3
• Mutation probability is 0.05
• Number of breeding attempts is 50


Input:
• The number of queens 𝑁,
• Size of the population sample 𝑛 ≥ 𝑁2 Ceiling(log_2 𝑁)

Branches:
  Main is the final commit brach
  AI a branch for anything AI Generated that we need to debug before initial commit make sure to put prompt in comments
  Test branch for anything we are trying that isnt working
